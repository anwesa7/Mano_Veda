📌 About the Project
ManoVed is a lightweight AI-powered tool that helps detect early signs of Alzheimer’s using voice recordings. It analyzes speech patterns such as pauses, energy, and speaking tempo to provide a Cognitive Health Score out of 100.

This is designed as a non-invasive, fast, and accessible solution to support early screening before medical tests become necessary.
